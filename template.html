    <h1>WE ENSURE A BETTER EDUCATION <br> FOR BETTER WORLD</h1>
    <p>A virtual exam study app where students can meet and discuss syllabus, review exam papers and content promoted via study tools, discussions, help, guidelines and free study material.As people are encouraged to stay a home, schools forced to close and students stay home, this requires students to continue learning from home.
As you know this is not possible without online study material. That is where Virtual Study comes in.The need for a virtual study platform is important to the ever developing technological systems. Very soon all content will be available online thus the need for Virtual Study,
The corona outbreak and its consequences to the school systems has even further created a huge gap of online study system requirement.
