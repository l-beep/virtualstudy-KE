        <h1>Benefits of Virtual Study Groups</h1>

        <p>There is no argument that taking time to read, learn, and study a subject or theory will lead to a greater
            understanding of that particular subject. Actively engaging with the material, learning together, and
            genuinely knowing a subject, students can feel empowered and motivated to do well in the classroom as a
            group.

            Learning is a different experience for each person. Students can hear different perspectives on the subject
            and therefore understand it from more than position. This is useful in real-world settings where more than
            one solution or opinion bolsters creative and analytical thinking.

            are bound to put off studying, homework, papers, and projects. A study group can help solidify and clarify
            course materials, leading to more promising classroom experiences, and potentially a better GPA. By
            understanding the subject and feeling motivated, students may feel more willing to do better in class, on
            tests, and on assignments.

            Also, for certain concepts, some students might be better at explaining the material to their fellow cohort.
            In a way, a study group is also a built-in tutoring session. For those who know the material, it is a great
            way to review and refine their understanding of it, and for those who may be struggling, they can gain a
            fresh perspective to suit their learning style better.</p>

        <p>By having each group member read, study, and summarize the most important points in a chapter, other students
            in the group gain the capability of understanding chapters at a deeper level. Different students might
            uncover themes or theories that others may not initially detect, so studying with others can be an
            eye-opening experience. Students can analyze their findings, which can serve as a standard to help determine
            the most important points of a chapter.

            This is also a way to get the full value of the class textbook. Unfortunately, students may be overwhelmed
            with the number of readings or assignments due in a semester and resort to surface learning, which is bound
            to fade as soon as the material feels as if it is no longer relevant. When various students share the burden
            of distilling dense material, they can appreciate the broader context of their studies more than tackling
            them alone.</p>

    <div class="col-md-10">
        <p>Study groups should allow each student to share ideas and thoughts about a particular subject. Depending on
            the groupâ€™s dynamic, students may even give small presentations that can be highly beneficial to the
            learning process; students who are going to present before their study groups are less likely to forget to
            do their reading because they do not want to be embarrassed in front of their peers.

            Some college students can find themselves to be naturally rebellious toward authority figures. This
            rebellious attitude can lead them to feel frustrated with academic assignments; however, the added
            responsibility of studying with a group of peers, and without the influence of an elder figure, can enable
            these students to feel more apt to participate, thus promoting responsibility, education, and team building.

            Besides personal responsibility, study groups can also aid in self-discovery. Perhaps students will realize
            that they work best in the morning or at night; perhaps they will discover that they are exceptionally good
            at researching but not summarizing. These insights can help them discover what kind of career will suit them
            best.</p>
