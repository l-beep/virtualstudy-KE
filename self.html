    <h1>Benefits Of Virtual Self Study</h1>
        <p>Exploring a topic on his or her own encourages your child to actively engage with the information.
            Self-studiers are able to think about topics more deeply and make connections between what they are
            learning. And when students are engaged (and excited) about what they are learning, they’re able to remember
            it better.

            Self-study also helps build study skills your child can use to explore new topics or tackle challenging
            schoolwork.</p>

    <div class="col-md-10">
        <p> Self-study is all about searching out new information on a topic your child is interested in. Seeking out
            this information themselves gives students a chance to learn more about that topic (rather than just what
            they are taught in class).</p>
        <p>Self-study allows students to take learning at their own pace, focusing on areas they are most interested in
            (or want to understand a bit better). This helps reduce feelings of frustration, anxiety, or boredom that
            students may struggle with in a classroom setting.</p>

    <div class="col-md-10">
        <p> Curiosity is one of the biggest (and often overlooked) pieces of motivating students to learn. When students
            aren’t engaged with what they are learning, they absorb less of the information. They study to memorize
            rather than understand. Self-study allows students to choose something they are interested in and excited to
            learn about, leading to a more effective learning experience</p>
