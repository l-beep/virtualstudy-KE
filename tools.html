    <h1>Awesome Virtual Research Tools</h1>
        <p>Todoist.
            Research is a time-intensive activity, which means you will need a tool to organize both your professional
            and personal life. We advise you to give Todoist a shot. Todoist enables you to manage all of your projects
            and access them from any platform you own, including your desktop computer, laptop, or portable devices. You
            can share your tasks and collaborate with other people. Another clever feature is “karma” points, which are
            given to users if they are successful in assigning tasks to projects.</p>
        <p>EndNote.
            EndNote is a multi-functional research tool which helps you search for information in online databases and
            full texts based on abstracts, as well as manage and auto-complete all of your references. Like Todoist,
            EndNote also enables you to share your research data with your collaborators. If you prefer to work alone,
            you can do that too by saving, managing and tagging your research results for better access. Other features
            include bibliography maker that is capable of creating citations in over 6,000 styles, as well as automatic
            journal suggestion.</p>
        <p>EduGeeksClub.
            Every once in a while, you are going to come across an insurmountable obstacle while doing your research.
            Instead of giving up, you can turn to EduGeeksClub for professional research help. Get in touch with
            professional writers and researchers and learn all the ins and outs of thorough research. Also, you can
            commission a paper from them which you can then use as a resource for your essay, paper, or dissertation.
            They also provide editing and proofreading services.</p>
        <p>Zotero.
            Another essential tool all online learners should make use of is Zotero. Zotero integrates itself seamlessly
            into your browser and uses its clever ability to automatically recognize content for you. After that, all it
            takes for you to save it to your personal, fully searchable library, which is another feature in Zotero, in
            a single click. It supports audio and video files, PDF documents, as well as most image formats.</p>
        <P>RefWorks.
            RefWorks is a browser-based tool which has the ability to help learners find the right research data,
            organize it, store it, and easily share it with their colleagues and collaborators. All of that research
            information and written work needs to be supported by proper citations, and RefWorks generates those for you
            automatically, as well as bibliographies in every style. If you are not sure how to make use of its full
            potential, there are plenty of tutorials on how to do it, right there on the website.</P>
        <P>DataElixir.
            One of the best ways to keep up to date with all the latest news, developments and data in science is to
            find a website which curates all of those on a weekly basis. We recommend Data Elixir. Whether you’re an
            eLearner, a scientist, or a researcher, you benefit a lot for its weekly collection of all the best data
            resources and news, and you don’t even have to put in any effort whatsoever. You just have to subscribe to
            their free weekly newsletter and that’s it.</P>
        <P>Paperpile.
            Paperfile is a reference management software which, similar to Zotero, works as an extension for Google
            Chrome browser, making it accessible for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux users. We recommend that you use it to
            find and import data from platforms like Google Scholar, PubMed, or arXiv. You can easily export all the PDF
            documents and data to Google Drive, which means you’ll have the opportunity for collaborative editing of
            your papers. The collaboration doesn’t end there, because you can send data back and forth between Paperpile
            and Zotero, for example, as well as Mendeley.</P>
        <P>DeepDyve.
            High-quality research papers and scholarly journals can often set you back a pretty penny, so it’s important
            for you to know exactly what you’re getting for the money you’ve paid. The only trouble is, you are often
            allowed to look at an abstract for free, and decide if you want to buy the full-text paper, and then realize
            it’s of no use to you. DeepDyve enables you to access the full-text articles for a limited period of time,
            enough for you to figure out if the paper is exactly what you are looking for.</P>
        <P>ContentMine.
            ContentMine is an online resource which aims to bring over 100,000,000 scientific facts close to the people,
            by converting the collective knowledge of the world that is present in scientific literature into content
            which can be read on your computes. All of its tools, features, and services are free and open access. They
            often cite Wikipedia and similar open projects as a source of their inspiration.</P>
        <P>Plagiarism Checker.
            In order to rid your work of duplicate content, run it through Plagiarism Checker, which will scan and
            determine if there is any duplicate content present. If there is, you either need to provide better
            citations, or rewrite your work so that it’s more unique.</P>
