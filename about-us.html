        <h3>" Virtual learning is a shared online space where the learners and the tutor work together simultaneously.<br>
            Usually, these interactions take place through videoconferencing. The participants have tools to present learning
            content in different formats,<br> as well as to implement collaborative and individual activities. In this type of
            interaction,<br> the teacher has the particularly important role of the moderator who guides the learning process
            and supports group activities and discussions".</h3>
