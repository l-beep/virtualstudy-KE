        <h1>Virtual Student Support Team</h1>
        <p>Effective student support can be seen as a key element in enhancing studentsâ€™ learning experience and has the
            potential to improve retention, progression and student achievement. The purpose of this research was to
            investigate student responses to the idea of using an avatar-based virtual support system and to develop
            such a system for piloting in a specific university service. A survey was conducted to establish the
            perceived need for such a system. A prototype system was then implemented in a limited domain, namely
            student employability and a further survey was conducted to obtain feedback from potential users as to its
            efficacy. This was generally positive and our intention is now to roll out the system across other
            university services.</p>
