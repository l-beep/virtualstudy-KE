        <h1>How to Be Successful in Virtual Test Taking</h1>
        <p>There's nothing more discouraging than turning your computer on to take a pre-scheduled test and discovering
            your equipment is not working or you have an access problem. As well as you are able, check out your
            computer ahead of the test. Make sure it's working and that your Wi-Fi connection is available.

            Give yourself time to get another computer or travel to an alternative Wi-Fi access point if needs be. It's
            also a good idea to open two different browsers, one to take the test in, and another to look up information
            (if you're allowed to do so). That way, you won't run the risk of inadvertently closing your exam and
            possibly losing results.</p>
        <p>Make sure you've turned off all distractions -- TV, phone, social media, and all notifications. Get the kids
            and pets settled ahead of time or find someone to take care of them so that you can proceed undistracted.
            Gather all the things you will need, including books, notebooks, pens or pencils to work out mathematical
            problems or to jot notes.</p>
        <p>Check and recheck the test time and date. Can you take the exam anytime within a certain window of time? How
            long will you have to complete the test? Go over any additional instructions thoroughly.</p>
        <p>Ask your instructor for a practice exam and take it. Ask for any additional recommendations for preparing for
            the test.

        </p>
        <p>Even if your exam is "open book," you need to be familiar with the material so you don't waste time hunting
            for it. By having a good mastery of the material, you can organize what you think you will need to know in
            study notes and in your mind so it's more easily accessible when you're answering exam questions.

        </p>
        <p>If you get stumped on a question, move on to the next one. You can come back and work on the questions that
            require more thought later.

        </p>
        <p>If you don't know the answer to a multiple choice question, start eliminating. Usually a few of the answers
            will be obviously incorrect, and may be similar in content or just don't seem to fit. Weigh those that seem
            closest to what the instructor is looking for, further eliminating as you work through to the answer.

        </p>
        <p>If you have limited time to take the test, set a watch or clock to alert you 10 minutes or so before your
            deadline so you will know how much time you have left to complete the test. Also, don't stay on one question
            for too long. Go back to it later if you're stuck.

        </p>
        <p>Don't despair, but do take screen shots and notify your instructor right away.

        </p>
        <p>Give yourself time to check and recheck your work before you submit it. Make sure all questions are answered,
            whether they're short answer or multiple choice. Remember, you will always get zero credit for the questions
            you don't answer.
